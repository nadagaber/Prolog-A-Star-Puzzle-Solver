# Prolog-A-Star-Puzzle-Solver

## Description:
This Prolog code aims to solve a puzzle using informed search, specifically the A* algorithm. The puzzle consists of a board with cells of various colors (Red, Yellow, or Blue), where each cell represents a state. Given a start and a goal cell of the same color, the task is to find a path between them while ensuring that all cells on the path have the same color.
The algorithm explores the search space systematically, prioritizing paths that are likely to lead to the goal based on a heuristic function. In this case, the heuristic function estimates the distance between a cell and the goal cell, guiding the search towards the most promising paths.

The Prolog code provides a systematic and efficient approach to solving the puzzle, leveraging the A* algorithm's capabilities to find optimal solutions.
